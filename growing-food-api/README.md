###  `🔨 Tools` 

For the backend I used mainly Python 🐍 with Django 🤵🏿🚬

It's quite simple to get the project running in your machine, you can start with a simple:

```
make build
```

Next step would be a good one to create your superuser so just run:
```
make superuser
```

If you want to change the models use:
```
make migration
```
and
```
make migrate
```
And finally, when you're done, just run:
```
make down
```
If you ever forget what command you're supposed to run just take a look at the Makefile and choose what suits you better.

Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did! 💚
