<h1 align="center">👩🏽‍🌾🌱 Growing Food API 🥗</h1>

This api will provide you not only a list of different type of vegetables you can grow at home, but also show you the way to get the job done.
It was created to help those that, just like me, can't even keep a cactus alive 🌵 or have no idea how to even start taking care of a plant 🥀.

###  `🔨 Tools` 

For the backend I used mainly Python 🐍 with Django 🤵🏿🚬

It's quite simple to get the project running in your machine, you can start with a simple:

```
make build
```

Next step would be a good one to create your superuser so just run:
```
make superuser
```

If you want to change the models use:
```
make migration
```
and
```
make migrate
```
And finally, when you're done, just run:
```
make down
```
If you ever forget what command you're supposed to run just take a look at the Makefile and choose what suits you better.

Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did! 💚
